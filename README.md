# Code-Challenge-1

Code problem details:

-----------

Pacman Simulator

Description:

- The application is a simulation of Pacman moving on in a grid, of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.
- There are no other obstructions on the grid.
- Pacman is free to roam around the surface of the grid, but must be prevented from moving off the grid. Any movement that would result in Pacman moving off the grid must  be prevented, however further valid movement commands must still be allowed.
- Create an application that can read in commands of the following form -

```
PLACE X,Y,F

MOVE

LEFT

RIGHT

REPORT
```

- PLACE will put the Pacman on the grid in positon X,Y and facing NORTH,SOUTH, EAST or WEST.
- The origin (0,0) can be considered the SOUTH WEST most corner.
- The first valid command to Pacman is a PLACE command, after that, any sequence of commands may be issued, in any order, including another PLACE command. The application should discard all commands in the sequence until a valid PLACE command has been executed.
- MOVE will move Pacman one unit forward in the direction it is currently facing.
- LEFT and RIGHT will rotate Pacman 90 degrees in the specified direction without changing the position of Pacman.
- REPORT will announce the X,Y and F of Pacman. This can be in any form, but standard output is sufficient.
- Pacman that is not on the grid can choose the ignore the MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT and REPORT commands.
- Input can be from a file, or from standard input, as the developer chooses.
- Provide test data to exercise the application.

**Constraints:**

- Pacman must not move off the grid during movement. This also includes the initial placement of Pacman.
- Any move that would cause Pacman to fall must be ignored.

Example Input and Output:
```
a)
PLACE 0,0,NORTH

MOVE

REPORT

Output: 0,1,NORTH
```
```
b)

PLACE 0,0,NORTH

LEFT

REPORT

Output: 0,0,WEST
```
```
c)

PLACE 1,2,EAST

MOVE

MOVE

LEFT

MOVE

REPORT

Output: 3,3,NORTH
```

**Deliverables:**
- Spend as little or as much time as you like on the challenge.
- The code you produce can be in any language
- *It is not required to provide any graphical output* showing the movement of Pacman.
- The output of the efforts *must be committed back into a Public Repo in Github* and the URL shared back for review.
- Proving your code works via unit testing is highly encouraged


# Getting Started with Pacman App

This project was bootstrapped with [Pacman App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
